# Corpus Manifest

This skill ships a fixed local corpus. The Markdown files below are consumed locally by the skill.

The skill itself performs no runtime forum calls. Corpus expansion can happen externally or via MCP during maintenance work and then be baked back in as static files.

## Corpus Tiers

- Tier 1 `full-post`: full body preserved, optionally with selected comments.
- Tier 2 `search-snapshot`: MCP search result captured as a static Markdown snapshot because full detail-page retrieval timed out repeatedly.
